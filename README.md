# "React - The Complete Guide" Notes

Code-along projects repo for [a great React course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on Udemy developed by [Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) </br>
The first time I take this course is at the end of 2019 ([check this repo](https://github.com/Zhenyuan-Li/Udemy-React)) when Class-based Components are still in trend. With the popularity of Hooks, Max has updated the entire course to fit the industry. So, I re-do the course with 1.5 speed-up for a refresh.

## Vincent's nagging

- Some of the sections are omitted due to different reasons (like debugging, deployment, tiny practice project...)
- My in-line comments in the demo code is also deserved to check.
- I am definitely a fan of Max, really like his teaching style and detailed explanation. Here are some his courses that I recommended. (All of them I have enrolled and finished.)
  1. [Vue - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/)
  2. [Next.js & React - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-react-the-complete-guide/)
  3. [Flutter & Dart - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/)
  4. [React Native - The Practical Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/) (actually half finished...)
  5. [Understanding TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/learn/lecture/16999308?start=15#overview)
     p.s. He really likes to use 'The Complete Guide'ðŸ˜‚. Again, Danke schÃ¶n, Max!
